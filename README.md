## üöÄ Project Overview

**Tagline:**  
File Storage in IPFS and CID stored in blockchain which reduces the gas cost and the file is encrypted using ECC. Verification of the original file is done using the PaddleOCR model.

### üìù The Problem it Solves

The project aims to create a **Comprehensive Automated Document Verification System** using **Blockchain**, **Interplanetary File System (IPFS)**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. This system securely stores and verifies official documents, leveraging blockchain technology for decentralized storage and data protection.

- **Document Storage**: Uses MetaMask wallet addresses to ensure only authorized users can access the documents.
- **Encryption**: Documents are encrypted using **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for secure transmission.
- **Verification**: A unique hash is generated from document metadata, extracted by an AI-powered OCR system (**PaddleOCR**), enabling fast, accurate verification in under a minute.

This solution allows organizations and individuals to grant access to documents by setting permissions, giving certificate holders full control over who can view the documents.

### üí° Challenges We Ran Into

**Technical Challenges**:  
Verifying low-quality images proved difficult, as poor image quality can prevent accurate metadata extraction and verification. Integrating technologies like IPFS, Polygon, and ECC also required overcoming complexities in decentralized data storage and transmission.

**Financial Challenges**:  
The cost of gas fees was a concern for users. By implementing **Polygon's zkEVM**, we significantly reduced transaction costs, easing the burden for users.

**Market Challenges**:  
Convincing organizations to shift from centralized to decentralized systems was challenging. Familiarity with traditional methods slowed adoption of blockchain technology.

**Operational Challenges**:  
User access management was crucial, as losing wallet addresses or passwords would prevent access to documents. A recovery mechanism involving credential verification by authorized officials was proposed.

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Set Up the Project

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

## 1. Clone the Repository
    
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git](https://github.com/Saravanakumar2005/Certificate_Verification.git)
    cd Certificate_Verification

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

    cd React
    cd gov_portal
    npm install

    cd React
    cd client_portal
    npm install

    cd Flask-Backend
    pip install requirement.txt

# Kubo IPFS Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (with WSL)
- **Go**: Version 1.18 or later
- **Git**: Version control system to clone the repository
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

You can check the versions of these dependencies by running:

bash
go version
git --version

If you don't have these installed, follow the links below to install them:

    Go
    Git
    Docker (if needed)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Kubo IPFS repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/ipfs/kubo.git
cd kubo

Step 2: Install Dependencies

    If you haven't already, install Go and set up the Go workspace:

go get github.com/ipfs/kubo

Build the Kubo IPFS binary:

    make build

This command compiles the Kubo IPFS binary, which can be used to run the IPFS node.
Step 3: Initialize IPFS

    Initialize your IPFS node (this sets up the configuration files and local storage for IPFS):

    ./kubo init

    This will create a .ipfs directory in your home folder and generate an initial configuration.

Step 4: Start the Kubo IPFS Daemon

Start the Kubo IPFS node:

    ./kubo daemon

This will start the IPFS daemon, which enables your machine to participate in the IPFS network. The daemon will run in the terminal, and you should see output confirming that your IPFS node is running.

## 3. Set Up Necessary Variables

INFURA_API_KEY=your-infura-api-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
IPFS_GATEWAY=your-ipfs-gateway
GROQ_API_KEY=your-GROQ_API_KEY

Replace the placeholders with your actual keys and values.
## 4. Compile the Smart Contracts

Compile the smart contracts using Hardhat:

    npx hardhat compile

## 5. Deploy the Smart Contracts

Deploy the contracts to the desired network (e.g., Polygon zkEVM) if you want to create a new contract instead of using ours:

    npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Lock.js --network zkEVM  --deployment-id <DeploymentId>    

## 6. Run the Frontend

Start the frontend application:

    npm run dev

On both the react apps

## 7. Run the Backend

    cd Flask-Backend
    python server.py

## 8. Interact with the Application

    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 & 5154.
    Connect your MetaMask wallet to interact with the smart contracts.
    Start uploading and verifying documents through the decentralized platform!
